## Adding dependencies

Simply add `react-ocean-forms` to your project dependencies.

### with yarn

`yarn add react-ocean-forms`

### with npm

`npm install react-ocean-forms`

## Optional packages

The `react-ocean-forms` package is the core package. While you can use it on it's own, we highly
recommend adding the `react-ocean-forms-bootstrap` package as well. It offers you easy bootstrap (reactstrap) integration.

If you're using `react-intl` in your project, add the `react-ocean-forms-react-intl` package for react-intl support.
